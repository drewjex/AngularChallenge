# record-manager-5000

Run `npm install` then `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Other Notes

I seem to always get a 415 Unsupported Media Type error when adding or updating a record using the API. My service appears to be set up correctly - I am not sure whether it is something wrong on my end or with the API.

## Thanks!
